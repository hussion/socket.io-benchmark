Simple socket.io benchmark.

For now, this project should be used to benchmark socket.io implementation itself,
and not projects built using it.

We are building it as a tool to compare WebSocket vs Comet performance, in terms of CPU,
Memory and Bandwith utilization.

We choose Socket.IO, because we could run the experiment using WebSocket,
and then run it again, using XHR-Polling, or JSON-Polling, by simply changing the available Transports.


There are two tests you can run:
* echo -> each client sends a message to the server, which sends it back to the same client, which repeats the process forever.

* broadcast -> each client sends a message to the server, which broadcasts it to all other clients.
  The server notify the client if the broadcast went ok.


Installation:
1) 'git clone git@github.com:slowthinker/socket.io-benchmark.git'
2) on created dir, 'npm install -d'
3) set ulimit 'ulimit -u <desired ulimit>'

* set ulimit to increase max number of opened sockets.

Run:
1)  Start server: 'node app.js'
    * See --help for parameters

2)  Start clients: 'node benchmark.js'
    * See --help for parameters

It is better to use many workers run with a single worker with a lot of connections, since node is single threaded.

Run 'node responsetime.js' to see current response time. It will connect another user,
that will send messages to the server, using the echo behaviour. The roundtrip time/latency is logged in milliseconds.

Output:
app.js will log the following line each second:
usr: 100 (+0/-0), recv/sec: 2500,    sent/sec: 2500,    recv/sec/usr: 25,        sent/sec/usr: 25

usr           -> Number of connected users, change in connections (+ .. new connections, - .. disconnections)
recv/sec      -> Messages received per second
sent/sec      -> Messages sent per second
recv/sec/usr  -> Messages received per second per user
sent/sec/usr  -> Messages sent per second per user

To verify global resources utilization (by server and multiple clients processes), use 'top', 'htop' (recomended) or something like it.

I'm quite new to node, socket.io and benchmarking. Any help is appreciated.
